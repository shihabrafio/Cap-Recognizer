Cap Recognizer is a simple yet efficient Python script designed to recognize and identify various types of caps or hats in images. The script utilizes machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect and classify caps accurately. It can be used for a variety of applications, including image classification, fashion analysis, and inventory management.

Key Features:

- Cap Detection: Automatically detects the presence of caps or hats within images.
- Classification: Utilizes machine learning models to classify different types of caps accurately.
- Easy Integration: Simple Python script that can be easily integrated into existing projects or workflows.
- Customization: Users can fine-tune the model or add their own dataset for specific cap recognition needs.
- Scalability: Can process large batches of images efficiently, making it suitable for both small-scale and large-scale applications.
- Cross-platform: Compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Open Source: The script is open-source, allowing users to modify and extend its functionality according to their requirements.

How to Use:

- Installation: Clone the repository or download the script files.
- Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (e.g., OpenCV, TensorFlow, etc.).
- Dataset Preparation: If required, prepare your dataset for training or fine-tuning the model.
- Training (Optional): Train the model using the provided dataset or your custom dataset for improved accuracy.
- Execution: Run the script and provide the path to the image(s) containing caps. The script will then detect and classify the caps accordingly.
- Output: Receive the classification results, which may include the type of cap detected along with confidence scores.
